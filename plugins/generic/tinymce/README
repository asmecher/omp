About
-----
This plugin converts all rich text enabled textareas to WYSIWYG XHTML editors using the TinyMCE
cross-browser Javascript editor (http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/).  This allows users to enter valid
HTML into the various forms for more control over the appearance of their content without requiring
knowledge of HTML.
